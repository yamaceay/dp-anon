The incident left me feeling upset and disrespected, and I believe it highlights a need for better training on how to handle sensitive situations.To provide context, my husband, Patrick, has entrusted me with managing his financial affairs due to his health challenges over the past five years. Despite my encouragement for him to handle these matters directly, he has requested that I speak on his behalf as he finds it difficult to process such discussions.During my visit, Phil asked Patrick about the nature of certain transactions. When I explained the situation and answered his questions, he repeatedly avoided making eye contact with me and directed his responses to my husband instead. When I encouraged him to speak with Patrick directly, his reply, \u201cbut you\u2019re the one talking and not Patrick, is it,\u201d felt dismissive and unprofessional. Phil then took Patrick aside for a private conversation, leaving me feeling excluded and undervalued despite my genuine efforts to provide clear and honest information.While I understand that it is the bank\u2019s responsibility to safeguard its customers, I believe the situation could have been handled with far greater sensitivity and professionalism. Managing my husband\u2019s finances is already a challenging and emotionally taxing responsibility, and this experience added unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.For 15 years, I have been financially independent, and stepping into this role was a decision made out of necessity due to my husband\u2019s health. I am deeply committed to ensuring his well-being, and I expected your staff to show understanding and empathy during this interaction.I hope you will take this feedback seriously and provide training for your team to better handle similar situations in the future. Customers managing financial matters on behalf of loved ones often face unique challenges and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.Thank you for taking the time to address this matter. I look forward to your response and to hearing how you plan to prevent similar experiences for other customers.Sincerely,Pamela Naylor ", "stars": 3, "review_id": 58705}, {"category": "Money & Insurance", "title": "Global Money incompetence", "review": "Update: HSBC complaint team have contacted me and handled the issue very well, so I've moved from 1 to 3 stars.Global Money:  transactions from a recent trip to italy are not managed correctly, resulting in a false \"debit\".
