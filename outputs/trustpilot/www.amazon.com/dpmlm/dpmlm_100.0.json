{"original": "What a shitty monopoly. They're full of drop shippers. And the worst part is they work their employees to death (literally...did anyone read about the tornado, the drivers made to stay on route, people who drop dead of heart attacks). This overworking leads to items not making it to their destination, items making it broken because they were hastily packed, people getting the wrong items. So then you have to spend your time doing their job as I have for the past two deliveries I've gotten from them...all while their owner doesn't pay them enough for food (they have the 3rd most employees on food stamps). So not only are you paying for shitty service, you're paying for their employees wages, while Bezos cosplays space cowboy.", "anonymized": ""}
